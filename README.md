## Gameplay

The gameplay consists of the following steps:

1. The computer generates a sequence of colored blocks that light up one by one.
2. The player attempts to reproduce the sequence by clicking on the blocks in the correct order.
3. If the player reproduces the sequence correctly, the computer generates a new sequence with an additional step.
4. The game continues until the player fails to reproduce the sequence or completes 20 steps in the sequence, in which case the player wins the game.

The game also includes a "Strict" mode, where a single mistake will cause the game to restart from the beginning.
